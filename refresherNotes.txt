Current TODO: Look into spacing out/ironing out reinforce timing/numbers
    - Lay out 'mine' trigger to blow people up in the marked treelines
    - Look into bolstering forces in air traffic entrance and main area.
        - Change units on radar tower and the radar setup
    - Reduce Garage units (1-3/1-4 at least) patrol radius
    - Add some cover around the helo spawns, as well and the entry into the 1st bases for East and South encounters
    - Replace SF LAT Rifleman with another unit

WEST is BLUFOR

Function Call/Variable syntax

//Function Call
[_player, _one, _two] execVM "path/to/script.sqf";

//params syntax option in function
params ["_player". "_one", "_two"]

//Needs to have the "'s around the variable names or it causes issues

//params alternative syntax in function
_player = _this select 0;
_one = _this select 1;
_two = _this select 2;

syntax works for sure

//Creating a function
set up the classes inside the Description.ext file

_y usage
Iterating over a HashMap with forEach will return the key as _x and the value as _y. 

AddAction wants the scripts to be enclosed in {}'s to be ran on action select

Unit names in Mission is done via Squad Leader name
'Squad Leader@Name to Display' is the syntax

Call vs execVM
Call: sync
    Throw compiled instructions onto the stack and waits for return

execVM: async
    private _handle = execVM "123.sqf";
    waitUntil { isNull _handle };

    _handle = player execVM "test.sqf";
    waitUntil { scriptDone _handle };
