Function Call/Variable syntax

//Function Call
[_player, _one, _two] execVM "path/to/script.sqf";

//params syntax option in function
params ["_player". "_one", "_two"]

//Needs to have the "'s around the variable names or it causes issues

//params alternative syntax in function
_player = _this select 0;
_one = _this select 1;
_two = _this select 2;

syntax works for sure

//Creating a function
set up the classes inside the Description.ext file

_y usage
Iterating over a HashMap with forEach will return the key as _x and the value as _y.
